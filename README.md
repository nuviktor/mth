Most Talkative Host
===================

Intended to be bolted on to MTC, this should allow me to auto-find the IP consuming the most bandwidth and print it to stdout. Unfinished, and currently only works on my network.

I've no previous experience in C so some of this could likely be cringeworthy.

The Makefile in the root directory integrates into the OpenWRT build process, so that I can cross-compile code to create binaries for my router.
